    "Working “in partnership with the chief medical officer of health and our local medical officers of health, we continue to closely monitor the evolving situation to advise if and when public health measures need to be adjusted,” the spokesperson also said.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Ontario’s first lockdown last spring, physiotherapy, chiropractic services and massage therapists were among those to close their doors, which left some confused about what is happening this time around.\n",
    "\n",
    "“We have to continue to communicate with clients that are calling and saying, ‘Are we seeing you on Monday or not?’ We’re having to say we’ll call you as soon as we know something more,” Armstrong said.\n",
    "\n",
    "“It’s not like a haircut,” she said, adding that people are often seeking massage to treat physical pain or for mental health care.\n",
    "\n",
    "To Armstrong, massage has been as important as mental healthcare for Ontarians during the months-long pandemic. “I see the fatigue setting in on everyone’s faces ... The stress is so high … right now, (with) people not being able to be with their families. It’s so important to have human touch.”\n",
