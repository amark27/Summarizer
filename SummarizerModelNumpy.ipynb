    "In Ontario’s first lockdown last spring, physiotherapy, chiropractic services and massage therapists were among those to close their doors, which left some confused about what is happening this time around.\n",

    "“It’s not like a haircut,” she said, adding that people are often seeking massage to treat physical pain or for mental health care.\n",
    "\n",
    "To Armstrong, massage has been as important as mental healthcare for Ontarians during the months-long pandemic. “I see the fatigue setting in on everyone’s faces ... The stress is so high … right now, (with) people not being able to be with their families. It’s so important to have human touch.”\n",
